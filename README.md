# Pseudo_Assembly_Compiler

This Pseudo assembly compiler was created as an assignment in one of my BSc courses using C.
It receives as an input an .as document with MIPS commands, checks their validity and gives out an output of 3 different files:
1: inputfilename.ob that returns all the machine code commands in hex.
2: inputfilename.ext that returns the value of the external labels in hex.
3: inputfilename.ent taht returns the entry of a label.
